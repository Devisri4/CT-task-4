## Task Overview:

In this task, we focused on integrating security scanning tools into a CI/CD pipeline to automate the process of detecting vulnerabilities during the build and deployment stages. We worked with **SonarQube** and **OWASP ZAP** as security scanning tools. This README outlines the steps taken, along with the tools used, and highlights any parts that were skipped.

## Tools Used
- **SonarQube**: A static code analysis tool that helps detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in your codebase.
- **OWASP ZAP**: A dynamic application security testing tool used for identifying security vulnerabilities in your running application.

## What We Did

### 1. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
   - Created a **GitHub Actions** workflow for automating the build, test, and deploy processes.
   - Set up a workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) with stages for building, testing, and deploying the application.

### 2. **Security Scanning with SonarQube**
   - Integrated **SonarQube** in the pipeline to analyze the code quality and security vulnerabilities during the build process.
   - Configured SonarQube to run on every commit to ensure that no new vulnerabilities are introduced into the codebase.
   - Added SonarQube analysis to the CI/CD pipeline configuration.

### 3. **Dynamic Security Scanning with OWASP ZAP**
   - Integrated **OWASP ZAP** in the pipeline for running dynamic security tests on the application during the deployment process.
   - Configured the OWASP ZAP tool to run against the deployed application to identify security vulnerabilities.

### 4. **Vulnerability Reports**
   - Set up SonarQube and OWASP ZAP to generate vulnerability reports after each scan.
   - Configured the pipeline to output the vulnerability reports to the GitHub Actions logs.

### 5. **Documentation**
   - Detailed steps for configuring the tools, setting up the pipeline, and interpreting the results from the vulnerability reports.

- **Installation of Tools**: We skipped the actual installation of SonarQube and OWASP ZAP, assuming they were already set up on the CI/CD environment or Docker containers.
- **Custom Security Configurations**: We didn't implement any custom configurations or rules for SonarQube and OWASP ZAP, sticking to their default security scanning profiles.
- **Advanced Security Testing**: Some advanced security testing configurations, such as custom script execution for OWASP ZAP, were skipped due to time constraints.
- **Full Integration Testing**: While the basic integration of SonarQube and OWASP ZAP was completed, comprehensive testing on different environments and edge cases was not fully implemented.

## Conclusion
This task successfully integrated security scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline, providing an automated way to detect security issues early in the development cycle. The vulnerability reports generated by SonarQube and OWASP ZAP help ensure the application remains secure as it progresses through the pipeline.
